    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <p>In online tests without proctoring, cases are often reported of impersonation and cheating. Students either ask someone else to take the test on their behalf or use methods of cheating like referring to a textbook, using smartphones or other devices to search for answers online or taking help from a friend. The two major concerns of the customer are cheating and student authentication. It ensures the candidate focuses on the test screen during the test; there is enough light in the room and checks for suspicious objects to red flag the test. It also uses face recognition to do student authentication. Develop a suitable product that can perform all these functionalities. Use suitable Computer Vision techniques for face recognition and identifying objects. The product should be able to detect each of the mentioned unfair means used by the student. Students are supposed to deploy the model using a website or Android application.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The idea behind an online test proctoring model is to use technology to monitor and proctor online exams to prevent cheating and ensure academic integrity. In addition to ensuring academic integrity, online test proctoring models can also provide benefits such as flexibility, convenience, and cost savings. Students can take exams from anywhere with an internet connection, and institutions can save resources by not having to hire physical proctors for online exams.</p>
    <p>This project is aimed at developing a suitable product that can perform all the required functionalities, which include cheating prevention and student authentication. The product is expected to ensure that the candidate focuses on the test screen during the test, there is enough light in the room, and that suspicious objects are flagged to prevent cheating. We will be using computer vision techniques for face recognition, identifying objects, and detecting each of the unfair means used by the student.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Multiple Face Detection</li>
		<p>Multiple face detection is a computer vision technique used to detect and locate multiple faces in a given image or video frame. It is used in a variety of applications, including surveillance systems, photo tagging applications, and online test proctoring.</p>
		<li>Face Authentication</li>
		<p>Face authentication in online test proctoring involves using a computer vision system to capture and analyze the test taker's face during the exam. The system compares the facial features of the test taker against the reference facial features on file to ensure that they remain the same person throughout the duration of the exam.</p>
		<li>Eye Tracking</li>
		<p>Eye tracking in online test proctoring involves using a camera or sensor to track the movements of the test taker's eyes while they are taking the exam. It can detect any suspicious behavior, such as if the test taker is looking away from the screen for an extended period or if they are constantly shifting their gaze.</p>
		<li>Smart Device Detection</li>
		<p>Smart device detection in online test proctoring involves using software that can detect the presence of any electronic device within the range of the exam area, such as a mobile phone, smartwatch, or tablet. It can help prevent cheating by ensuring that the test taker is not using any electronic devices to access unauthorized resources during the exam.</p>
